# Advanced Courses, Summer Schools, and Workshops (Academic Professional Development)

This page lists advanced courses, summer schools, workshops, and longer training programs I have undertaken over the years. Many are beyond standard university degrees and reflect sustained learning and development. This page is separate from publications and does not list original research papers; those are shown on dedicated publication pages.

For degrees and post-docs, see [education] page.
