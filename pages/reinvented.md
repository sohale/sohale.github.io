# Things I reinvented

and later I realised are already invented:

## Genuinely invented
but later realised they were invented or re-invented

### Computer Engineering/Science
* awk (A cascadable grep/awk/sed -like tool set for DOS (without being aware of them in Unix)
    * when: 1995
    * for: MS DOS/Windows
    * disillusioned: by awk/sed

* Remote terminal
    * when: 1997
    * preceeded: VNC
    * for: Windows 95, Win32
* RISC: Reduced Instruction Set
   * Invented in 1989-1990 (age 12)
   * Not physically implemented. Remained on paper.

Algorithms:

* Merge sort algorithm
    * reinvented, without knowing, the Merge Sort
    * Distribution -aware sorting

* Universal Mechanics problem solver (Physics Engine)
   * Did not fully work (for slicing objects)

* GUI-... (A GUI system based on state machines & using a )
   * featured its own a programming language (DSL)
   * used state machines
   * used delay
   * used message passing
   * Featured a CSS-like vector language
   * Fully implemented
   * "Smoother" for mouse pointer (with pose) -- (prototypical Kalman filter)

* VVVV-like
   * VVVV, a node-like toolkit

Theoretical models and models of computation:

* Rewrite grammars (see findreplace)
   * A Perl-like language

* Multi-head TM (a theoretical idea near-memory computing)

* Reconfigurable TM
   * (related to multi-level caching)

Hardware:

* Runtime-pluggable Transputers
   * Also see TPUs (but not related to that)

* Advanced caching schemes (...)
* Multi-level

  
* DSL ...
   * Encoding data scheme as code structure using reflection/inbtrospections
   * 2002 or 2003

* CPU description language (an idea related to HW/SW co-design)

* Programming languages
   * ownership pointers (the idea that made Rust-language a hit)
   * Data flow analysis
   * Compile-time types & arguments (made popular in Zig)
   * Compile-time as a legitimate mode (made popular in Zig)
 
* File-format description language
* A glyph description language (used to implement a full-featured Persian display and editing language: before Unicode and before you could have fonts on HTML )
* A melody notation language

* The ChainTree(Flowtree) concept
* The "templator" concept & DSL language (with aplpicaiton in APIs)

* My own version of raster to vector
* My own version of geological mapping (interpolation) based on sparse depth observations (for reservoir exploration)

### Mathematics:
* (incomplete) Computational Logic: Symbolic system, automated differentiation
   * disillusioned by: Mathematica
* Contours of potentials from phase flow vector spaces (not finished. not solved)
   * Hamiltonian

* Interpolation based on 1/r and 1/r^2 (limits)

* Histogram Equalisation: grey-scale (and colour?) in image processing.

* A simple version of MCMC Algorithm
   * (for any arbitrary non-normalised distribution)


## Concept: not fully implemented:

* a proto-qemu
   * A IBM PC-XT

* software-hardware codesign
* FPGA for deep learning (instrad of GPUs)
   * preceded: TPUs
* terraform

* A rewrite system (Rewriting grammars)
   * that was Turing Complete
   * For online realtime information processing
   * General purpose

* Recurrent Neural Networks
   * 1997
   * disillusioned by: TDNN
   * a q-Markov variant

* Protein Folding (using? gradient-descent?)

## Neuroscience:
* Optimal Experiment Design (adaptive)
    * identifucation with brain in the loop
* System Identification by modular
* GIL (similar, but different to Free Energy Principle)
* A certain version of Information Bottleneck

* Transfer Entropy!
(Yes, I invented it independently, before reading about it)

* Information Lattice
   * later: Bell

* Earth-Moving Distance (EMD)

* The discovery that retinal cells in the periphery are more sensitive to lightness (lower threshold of peripheral vision)
   * During my childhood psychophysics-like experiments (by observing stars and galaxies are visible only by the corner of the eyes, and making sense of it and noting it and framing it as a concept, not dismissing it as an error.
   * First, It was annoying me and after a while I realised it is a robust phenomenon.)
   * The "Averted Vision" phenomenon: peripheral vision (rods) is more sensitive and has a lower threshold for vision.
   * I didn't know it was specific for black-and-white vision
   * I could almost see Andromeda, but since I could re-detect it using foveal vision, I dismissed this ability to see the Andromeda galaxy.


* Invariances & some properties of in multi-dimensional distributions (whitening)

* The dithering method in statistical modelling

* Bayesian Attention
* Dith. method

* The dithering method in graphics using some heuristic optimalirty and using Vector quantization
   * A prototype of some aspects of predictive coding for eye
   * (Search for what can be and cannot be detected by eyes)

## Business ideas (not implemented)
* Twitter: social network by limiting (constraining) the message length

### Reinvented knowing they exist, based on the genral idea, without any technical details (in pre-internet):
* Metaballs (Implicit Surface Modellimg rendering using Ray Casting)

### Chemistry:
* Glycerol with potassium permanganate causing explosive reaction
(accidental childish discovery, about age 10, ~1987 )

### Music
* PAGWA instrument (digital sliding guitar)
* Fully implemented using MIDI & using a Nichrome heater element & A/D converter, functional on Amiga.
* Recorded some music with it


### Not reinvented, but made
* A telescope, 1988 (Using lenses made for glasses, and a weak binocular's eyepiece, and a cardboard pipe)

### Misc
podcasting
( 1985? )
