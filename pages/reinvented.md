# Things I reinvented

and later I realised are already invented:

## Genuinely invented
but later realised they were invented or re-invented

### Comouter Engineering/Science
* awk
    * when: 1995
    * for: MS DOS/Windows
    * disilusioned by: awk/sed
* Remote terminal
    * when: 1997
    * preceeded: VNC
    * for: Windows 95, Win32
* RISC: Reduced Instruction Set
   * Not ohysically built

* Perl-like

* Universal Mechanics problem solver (Physics Engine)
   * Did not fully work (for slicing objects)

* GUI-...
   * used state machines
   * used delay
   * used message passing

* VVVV-like
   * VVVV, a node-like toolkit

### Mathematics:


## Concept: not fully implemented:

* a proto-qemu
   * A IBM PC-XT

* software-hardware codesign
* FPGA for deep learning (instrad of GPUs)
   * preceeded: TPUs
* terraform

* Rewriting grammars

* Recurrent Neural Networks
   * 1997
   * disinllusioned by: TDNN
 
## Neuroscience:
* Optimal Experiment Design (adaptive)
    * identifucation with brain in the loop
* System Identification by modular
* GIL (similar, but different to Free Energy Principle)


### Reinvented knowing they exist, based on the genral idea, without any technical details (in pre-internet):
* Metaballs
*
