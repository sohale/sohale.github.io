# Things I reinvented

and later I realised are already invented:

## Genuinely invented
but later realised they were invented or re-invented

### Comouter Engineering/Science
* awk
    * when: 1995
    * for: MS DOS/Windows
    * disilusioned by: awk/sed
* Remote terminal
    * when: 1997
    * preceeded: VNC
    * for: Windows 95, Win32
* RISC: Reduced Instruction Set
   * Not ohysically built

* Perl-like

* Merge sort algorithm

* DSL ...
   * 2002 or 2003

* Universal Mechanics problem solver (Physics Engine)
   * Did not fully work (for slicing objects)

* GUI-...
   * used state machines
   * used delay
   * used message passing

* VVVV-like
   * VVVV, a node-like toolkit

### Mathematics:
* (incomplete) Computational Logic: Symbolic system, automated differentiation
   * disillusioned by: Mathematica
* Contours of potentials from phase flow vector spaces (not finished. not solved)
   * Hamiltonian

* Interpolation based on 1/r and 1/r^2 (limits)

* Histogram Equalisation: grey-scale (and colour?) in image processing.

* A simple version of Metropolis MCMC Algorithm
* (for any arbitrary non-normalised distribution)


## Concept: not fully implemented:

* a proto-qemu
   * A IBM PC-XT

* software-hardware codesign
* FPGA for deep learning (instrad of GPUs)
   * preceeded: TPUs
* terraform

* Rewriting grammars

* Recurrent Neural Networks
   * 1997
   * disinllusioned by: TDNN
   * a q-Markov variant

* Protein Folding (using? gradient-descent?)

## Neuroscience:
* Optimal Experiment Design (adaptive)
    * identifucation with brain in the loop
* System Identification by modular
* GIL (similar, but different to Free Energy Principle)
* A certain version of Information Bottleneck
* Transfer Entropy!
(Yes, I invented it independently, before reading about it)
* Information Lattice
   * later: Bell

* Earth-Moving Distance (EMD)

* The "Averted Vision" phenomenon: perioherial vision (rods) is more sensitive amd has lower threshold for vision.


* Invariances in multi-dimentional distributions (whitening)

* Bayesian Attention
* Dith. method


## Business ideas (not inplemented)
* Twitter: social network by limiting (constraining) the message length

### Reinvented knowing they exist, based on the genral idea, without any technical details (in pre-internet):
* Metaballs (Implicit Surface Modellimg rendering using Ray Casting)

### Misc
podcasting
( 1985? )

journalling (magazine)

### Chemistry:
* Glycerol with potassium permanganate causing 
(accidental discovery)

### Music
* PAGWA instrument (digital sliding guitar)


### Not reinvented, but made
* A telescope, 1988 ?
