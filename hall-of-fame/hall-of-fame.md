# The Software Hall of fame

My favourite softwares:

* 🏅 **WinAmp**
* 🏅 **IntelliJ IDEA**

Criteria:
* They are make so well that are difficult not to mention somewhere.
* Robust: Practically bugfree. For logic that is usually complicated. Usual software struggle in much simmpler logic.
* Software Quality that you can feel (their difference).
* Stretching your imagination
* They simply did more than what you thought would be possible
* Completely solving a difficult problem: overkill
* Moving the standard: Setting the new standards, while nothing better came after them
* Perfect requirement engineering: Knowing the real needs of users, making them accessible and well organised, especially professional users
* They show perfect software exists.

Notable mention:
* 🏅 (the famous) **PhotoShop**
* 🏅 **CoolEdit**

### Associagted people:

Above software are made by real human beings, not superhumans. They are worth mentioning:

* Dmitry Boldyrev
* Sergey Dmitriev, Valentin Kipyatkov and Eugene Belyaev
* Thomas Knoll and John Knoll

###  🏅 WinAmp
from NullSoft

Graphically perfect (probably can only come from Utah), elegant simplicity, and later, those visualisations.

Lots of decisions that make you smile

###  🏅 IntelliJ IDEA
from JetBrains

Jut beyond my imagination. It also worked always pefectly without bugs, while doing complicated logic.


### Notable mentions
#### Photoshop
For being robust, can be used for professional (unlimited image quality) on simple computers at the time.
Well organisaiton of functions
