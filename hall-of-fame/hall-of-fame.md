# The Software Hall of fame

My favourite softwares:

* 🏅 **WinAmp**
* 🏅 **IntelliJ IDEA**

Criteria:
* They are make so well that are difficult not to mention somewhere.
* When you use them you notice lots of decisions that make you smile.
* When you use them, you are amazed that they exist
* Robust: Practically bugfree. For logic that is usually complicated. Usual software struggle in much simmpler logic.
* Software Quality that you can feel (their difference).
* Stretching your imagination
* They simply did more than what you thought would be possible
* Completely solving a difficult problem: overkill
* Moving the standard: Setting the new standards, while nothing better came after them
* Perfect requirement engineering: Knowing the real needs of users, making them accessible and well organised, especially professional users
* Each of them proves the perfect software exists.
* The magic must be there, clear in their early versions, before growin up to higher versions, or before some of them expand into grand commercial sucesses.
* (Usually) provide *complicated* functionality (in a simple, accessible way)



Perfect software are not too many to list.
You just feel this quale (qualia) when you *experience* them by using them.

Being a perfect software also shows up when it grows: A bad software foundation shows when you add features and grow it.

Notable mention:
* 🏅 **PhotoShop** (the famous)
* 🏅 **CoolEdit**


I just need to include these too, although I havent' experenced them personally.
Perfect software are not too many to list, so I must list them.
* 🎗 **Sketchpad** -- Sketchpad (a.k.a. Robot Draftsman) by Ivan Sutherland in 1963.

### Associated people:

Above software are made by real human beings, not superhumans. They are worth mentioning:

* Dmitry Boldyrev
* Sergey Dmitriev, Valentin Kipyatkov and Eugene Belyaev
* Thomas Knoll and John Knoll

(to be continued)

## Explanation

###  🏅 WinAmp
from NullSoft

Graphically perfect (probably can only come from Utah), elegant simplicity, and later, those visualisations.

Lots of decisions that make you smile.

###  🏅 IntelliJ IDEA
from JetBrains

Jut beyond my imagination. It also worked always pefectly without bugs, while doing complicated logic.


### Notable mentions
#### 🎗 Photoshop
For being robust, can be used for professional (unlimited image quality) on simple computers at the time.
Well organisaiton of functions

#### 🎗 CoolEdit
Later: Adobe Audition

#### 🎗 **Sketchpad**
Sketchpad (a.k.a. Robot Draftsman) by Ivan Sutherland in 1963.

Must have been software-design-ed (software-engineer-ed) in a great way from the outset.


### Third grade
#### 🎗 **git**
By Mr Linus.

While being perfect, and revolutionaly, and trasforming, the cli is overcomplicated and take time to master. It is awaiting next revolution.
In all other respects, it is a perfect software.

### 🎗 **bash**
Unix and bash certainly belong here.
However, bash has certain annoyances.

The pipe `|` function along can make it inot this list.
It had the ideas of REST from tohse early times.
Bash pipes alone are an insightful discovery. Not sure what the sources are.

## .
Notable bad software:
* Spotify, early Facebook, ...
* Text editors: they constantly evolve, some of them are amazing. But no single one was a revolution. `vscode` is great though.
