# The Software Hall of fame

My favourite softwares:

* 🏅 **WinAmp**
* 🏅 **IntelliJ IDEA**

Criteria:
* They are make so well that are difficult not to mention somewhere.
* When you use them you notice lots of decisions that make you smile.
* When you use them, you are amazed that they exist
* Robust: Practically bugfree. For logic that is usually complicated. Usual software struggle in much simmpler logic.
* Software Quality that you can feel (their difference).
* Stretching your imagination
* They simply did more than what you thought would be possible
* Completely solving a difficult problem: overkill
* Moving the standard: Setting the new standards, while nothing better came after them
* Perfect requirement engineering: Knowing the real needs of users, making them accessible and well organised, especially professional users
* Each of them proves the perfect software exists.
* The magic must be there, clear in their early versions, before growin up to higher versions, or before some of them expand into grand commercial sucesses.
* (Usually) provide *complicated* functionality (in a simple, accessible way)
* I feel nostalgic after not using them for a while. Maybe because other software did not provide that.
* You don't feel there is an improvement needed. The problem-solving opportunities of improvement don't happen. Sometimes, whatever you imagine, you can find ways to do it.
* Are examples that are ready in my mind ans examples for people to show possibility of writing good code.
* Has to be non "bloated"! Example [here](https://gearspace.com/board/music-computers/395573-cool-edit-pro-2-1-appreciation.html).


Perfect software are not too many to list.
You just feel this quale (qualia) when you *experience* them by using them.

Being a perfect software also shows up later on when it grows further:
A bad software foundation shows when you add features and grow it.

These lists are liquid:
I will move some between the main list, "Notable mentions" and third-grade lists.
It just takes time and comteplattion to find their right place.

Notable mention:

* 🏅 **CoolEdit**

I just need to include the following too, although I havent' experenced them personally.
Perfect software are not too many to list, so I must list them.
* 🎗 **Sketchpad**

### Associated people:

Above software are made by real human beings, not superhumans. They are worth mentioning:

* Dmitry Boldyrev (WinAmp)
* Sergey Dmitriev, Valentin Kipyatkov and Eugene Belyaev (IntelliJ IDEA)
* Robert Ellison and David Johnston (for Cool Edit)


(to be continued)

## Explanation

###  🏅 WinAmp
from NullSoft

Graphically perfect (probably can only come from Utah), elegant simplicity, and later, those visualisations.

Lots of decisions that make you smile.

Name: Earlier version (for Mac) was called `MacAmp`

###  🏅 IntelliJ IDEA
from JetBrains

Jut beyond my imagination. It also worked always pefectly without bugs, while doing complicated logic.


### Notable mentions
#### 🎗 Photoshop
By Thomas Knoll and John Knoll

For being robust, can be used for professional (unlimited image quality) on simple computers at the time.
Well organisaiton of functions

Well-known in popular culture, but less famous for its engineering/software/design excellence.

#### 🎗 CoolEdit
Later: Adobe Audition


(It later was acquired by Adobe and became the bloated Adobe Audition)

Originally by Robert Ellison and David Johnston in the early 1990s (Syntrillium Software).
It was basically a Photoshop for audio.

Name: Cool Edit -> Cool Edit Pro -> Cool Edit Pro v2 -> Adobe Audition

See another [appreciation page](https://gearspace.com/board/music-computers/395573-cool-edit-pro-2-1-appreciation.html).

Quote:
> Syntrillium have managed to improve this popular, cost-effective, multi-faceted audio editing software package in just about every direction, while also adding a lot of new functionality — all of which is useful rather than just clever. Cool Edit Pro deserves to be taken seriously as an audio workstation par excellence. [1](https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/syntrillium-cool-edit-pro-v2)


#### 🎗 **Sketchpad**
Sketchpad by Ivan Sutherland in 1963.

Must have been software-design-ed (software-engineer-ed) in a great way from the outset.

Name: Originally called `Robot Draftsman`

### Third grade
The folllowing are too famous for this and area already recognised and appreciated.

#### **git**
By Linus.

While being perfect, and revolutionaly, and trasforming, the cli is overcomplicated and take time to master. It is awaiting next revolution.
In all other respects, it is a perfect software.
It certainly deserves the main list for being compelling and rigorous. But it annoys you too (by being a bit of a git). I feel there is an improvement is needed.

### **bash**
Unix and bash certainly belong here.
However, bash has certain annoyances.

The elegant "pipe" `|` function alone can make it into this list.
It had the ideas of REST from tohse early times.
Bash pipes alone are an insightful discovery. Not sure what the sources are.

Too well-known for the main list.

### **Unix**
The Unix itself. Not explanation is needed.

However, Unix is larger than a software. It containes most of the computer science.

Too well-known for the main list.

### Others:
* Apple 1 (Wozniak)

### Specific aspects
* _matlab_ -- Matlab's style of defining functions in a pragmatic and simple way never stopped amazing me. I never understoood the magic that drives that style of design. I believe it actually inspired Python.
* _Mathematica_ -- Just does too many good things. You can find a wealth of mathematcs there.

## N.B.S.
Notable bad software:
* Spotify, early Facebook, ...
* Text editors: they constantly evolve, some of them are amazing. But no single one was a revolution. `vscode` is great though.
