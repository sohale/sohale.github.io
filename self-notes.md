# Notes for future:

If it didn't publish, check this-repo / settings/GitHub Pages (scroll down). There maybe error messages.

Specifically,
"Your site is having problems building: The submodule registered for ./demos/implisolid-build could not be cloned. Make sure it's using https:// and that it's a public repo. For more information, see https://docs.github.com/github/working-with-github-pages/troubleshooting-jekyll-build-errors-for-github-pages-sites#invalid-submodule. "

Another source:
"In order for your site to be published, a Jekyll theme must be chosen, even if you donâ€™t use Jekyll at all."
